## **üîÅ STEP 1: UPDATE GITHUB DATA**

Ensure that the **latest `RI.csv` file** is uploaded to the **`Master-Script` repository** at:

üëâ [`https://github.com/MariaKlap/Master-Script`](https://github.com/MariaKlap/Master-Script)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The file name **must be `RI.csv`** for the comparison and merging to work properly.

1. Download `MasterscriptGit.py` from this repository.
2. Place it in a working folder.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python MasterscriptGit.py
   ```

This will generate the following files in the same directory:

- `RI.xlsx`: Combined news entries from all Excel sources  
- `RI.csv`: CSV version of the combined news

- `News.xlsx`: Newly published articles compared to existing GitHub data  
- `RI_News.docx`: Word report for Regulatory Affairs team

  import sqlite3
  import pandas as pd

  # Change this to the full local path where your RI.db file is stored
  db_path = r'C:\Path\To\Your\RI.db'  # ‚Üê replace with actual path

  conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)

  query = "SELECT * FROM regulatory_intelligence"
  df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

  conn.close()
  ```

- Click **OK** and import the data.
