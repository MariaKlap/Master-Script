Coordinated assessment for clinical investigations: a call for expression of interest;"Member States, supported by the European Commission, are pleased to announce the launch of a pilot coordinated assessment of clinical investigations and performance studies across multiple Member States as per Articles 78 of the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) and 74 of the Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR) respectively. This pilot will allow sponsors to submit a single application for pilot coordinated assessments, assuring more harmonised interaction with the Member States approving the clinical investigation or performance studies. Additionally, participant sponsors will help the competent authorities of Member States with building a fast and fit for purpose EU system for coordinated assessment once its mandatory operation starts as required in Article 78(14) MDR and Article 74(14) IVDR (modified by Regulation (EU) 2024/1860 , Articles 1(3) and 2(2) respectively). The goal is to implement a harmonised, predictable process across Member States, reducing administrative burden for sponsors and ensuring high transparency and consistency in the coordinated assessment. By participating in the pilot for coordinated assessment, sponsors can benefit from the following: Unified engagement : engage with all the EU countries involved, thus making communication more efficient and clearer while reducing delays. More transparency and harmonisation : the pilot will enhance transparency, giving sponsors better visibility of the evaluation process across EU countries by access to the operational procedures. Member States will work together becoming familiar with each other’s practices and particularities, thus increasing harmonisation. Simplified requests for information : experience a more efficient request for information (RFI) process, reducing potential complexities compared to non-coordinated assessments. Consistency across Member States : reduce discrepancies in assessment due to different national interpretations. Document management efficiency : a lower number of submissions is expected during the assessment process. Simplified management of substantial modifications : substantial modifications are also planned to be coordinated, ensuring a smooth and coherent process. Faster overall process : coordinated assessment procedures will enable faster decisions at the national level. Sponsors conducting clinical studies that involve multiple Member States are encouraged to apply. However, to participate in the pilot, sponsors must meet the following criteria: The clinical investigation or performance study must require authorisation under Article 62(1) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) or Article 58(1)-(2) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR), as detailed below. The study must be multinational and involve at least two participating Member States agreeing to join the coordinated assessment pilot. For the medical devices, the investigational device must fall into one of the following categories: Medical Devices Regulation (MDR): investigational devices in class III invasive investigational devices in class IIa invasive investigational devices in class IIb In Vitro Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR): performance studies carried out under Article 58(1)(b) performance studies carried out under Article 58(1)(c) performance studies carried out under Article 58(2) involving companion diagnostics. Medical Devices Regulation (MDR): investigational devices in class III invasive investigational devices in class IIa invasive investigational devices in class IIb investigational devices in class III invasive investigational devices in class IIa invasive investigational devices in class IIb In Vitro Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR): performance studies carried out under Article 58(1)(b) performance studies carried out under Article 58(1)(c) performance studies carried out under Article 58(2) involving companion diagnostics. performance studies carried out under Article 58(1)(b) performance studies carried out under Article 58(1)(c) performance studies carried out under Article 58(2) involving companion diagnostics. The following Member States confirmed their participation in the pilot coordinated assessment: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Norway. The current availability along with practical details for each Member State. Sponsors interested in participating in the EU pilot coordinated assessment should: For medical devices. complete the expression of interest form email it to: SANTE-CA-CIPS ec [dot] europa [dot] eu (SANTE-CA-CIPS[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu) by the 30th of June 2025. Use “Expression of interest for coordinated assessment pilot” as the subject line of your email. Please note that the actual date of submission of the application will be determined independently from the expression of interest, based on sponsor's timelines, in agreement with the Member States. The call for IVD will be opened at a later stage. The expressions of interest will be reviewed on a rolling basis by MDCG Clinical Investigation and Evaluation Working Group members based on: eligibility criteria potential impact on public health of both the clinical investigation or the performance study. Selected sponsors will be notified immediately after the review is finalised, and additional instructions will be provided (see FAQ ). Once a sponsor is selected for the pilot, the secretariat will make available an information package outlining the next steps and providing SOPs, tutorials, and templates. The sponsor will have two weeks to raise questions and request bilateral exchanges with the secretariat and Member States for clarification if needed. A team within the European Commission ensures the secretariat of the pilot coordinated assessment for clinical investigations and performance studies. For more information on the call or the application process, please contact SANTE-CA-CIPS ec [dot] europa [dot] eu (SANTE-CA-CIPS[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu) . To participate in the pilot coordinated assessment, you will need to submit the following: the documentation outlined in MDCG 2021-8 (for the Clinical Investigation Plan refer to MDCG 2024-3 , for Investigator’s Brochure refer to MDCG 2024-5 ); additionally, if required by specific Member States, national documentation – these documents are necessary for the initial application submission and are needed for dossier’s validation and subsequent assessment during the pilot documents for confirmatory submission at national level, required at the end of the coordinated assessment, in accordance with the Member States’ respective national procedures. The details of the above will be clarified either in the sponsor’s package or during the dedicated pre-submission meetings with the Member States.

Expression of interest open – Possible second call for EU reference laboratories for high-risk in vitro diagnostic medical devices;In July 2022, the European Commission launched a call for the designation of EU reference laboratories in 8 categories of class D devices. Applicant laboratories had six months to prepare and submit applications to their Member State. The Commission reviewed the applications based on the following elements specified in the call: the applicant laboratories must satisfy all the criteria the combined capacity of all compliant laboratories in each category must cover the expected volume of requests for tasks related to the conformity assessment of devices. Following the completion of the selection procedure in December 2023, the European Commission designated 5 EU reference laboratories covering the following categories of class D devices: Hepatitis and retroviruses Herpesviruses Bacterial agents Respiratory viruses that cause life-threatening diseases The following act designates the laboratories: Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/2713 designating EU reference laboratories in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical devices . For the remaining 4 categories, namely arboviruses, haemorrhagic fever and other biosafety level 4 viruses, parasites and blood grouping, at the closing time of the call there were either no applicants that satisfied the criteria or their combined capacity was insufficient to cover the expected volume of requests. Therefore, no EU reference laboratory was designated for these categories of devices following the first call. The Commission, after consulting the Member States in the Medical Device Coordination Group , is considering launching a second call to cover the remaining categories of class D devices: Arboviruses Haemorrhagic fever and other biosafety level 4 viruses Parasites Blood grouping Interested laboratories are invited to informally express interest to their Member State by 30 April 2024. You can find a list of authorities in EU Member States and other eligible countries responsible for selection of EU reference laboratories and their contact details under “ Contact points for candidate EU reference laboratories ”. This list is not yet complete and is periodically updated. If you do not find the contact details of the responsible authority in your country, you can refer to the general list with contact details of authorities responsible for medical devices and IVDs under “Contact points” on the same page. Should there be significant interest, a formal call will be launched with instructions on how to apply and provide the supporting documents. More information about this will be published on this page. To be designated as an EURL in the second round, a laboratory would have to fulfil the same criteria as in the first call. These are laid down in Article 100(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 and are further detailed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/944 on tasks and criteria for EURLs. They include, for example, the availability of adequately qualified staff and equipment, knowledge of standards and best practices, independence among others. To provide more time for candidate EURLs to prepare applications and make the necessary organisational arrangements, the second call for laboratories could be open longer than the first call, which was set for 6 months. The requested capacities for performance verification and batch release are not expected to exceed those outlined in the information package for candidate laboratories. EU reference laboratories in the field of IVDs are designated to perform important tasks outlined in Article 100 of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 . EURLs verify the performance of class D devices and compliance with common specifications and they perform batch testing of class D devices in response to requests by notified bodies. EU reference laboratories form a network to coordinate and harmonise their working methods regarding testing and assessments. EURLs provide scientific and technical assistance to the European Commission, the MDCG, Member States and notified bodies about implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/746. EURLs also provide scientific advice regarding the state of the art, and contribute to developing appropriate testing and analysis methods, common specifications and international standards. The laboratories provide recommendations on suitable reference materials and reference measurement procedures. They collaborate with notified bodies in the development of best practices for the performance of conformity assessment procedures. EURLs also set up and manage a network of national reference laboratories and publish a list of the participating national reference laboratories and their respective tasks.

These are reports of suspected side effects that have been sent directly to the pharmaceutical companies. - An increased number of reports contributes to an earlier discovery of new safety risks with drugs. It is especially important to report serious or unknown suspected side effects.
